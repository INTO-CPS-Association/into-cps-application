        The app is composed of 2 primary views: On the left, the project browser left is always visible. It shows the various components of an INTO-CPS project. These components can be clicked to trigger various actions. 
        In the center, the main view is shown. The contents of this view depend on which action has been trigerred in the project browser. A few example views are shown below.
