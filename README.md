INTO-CPS Application
---

The INTO-CPS Application is the frontend of the INTO-CPS Tool Chain. It is used
to configure and run FMI-based co-simulations. Other features include model
checking, test automation and design space exploration.

The App is primarily a UI. Most of the modelling and simulation work is done by
the INTO-CPS tools themselves. These can be downloaded from within the app.

How to build
---
The app is built with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) and
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 recommended). You need npm (comes with Node.js). Npm 6 or higher is required. Npm
can be upgraded with `npm install npm@latest -g`. We use Gulp to manage tasks. It's easiest to have it installed globally (`npm install -g gulp`). 

After checking out the repo:

1. To install node dependencies: `npm install`
2. To build the UI: `gulp`
3. To run it: `npm start`
4. To run the tests: `npm test`


Development
---
For an editor, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a good choice. It's
cross-platform and is actually built on top of Electron. That said, you can use
whatever you want.

Latest builds
---
The master branch is built automatically on git pushes and the output, for
successful builds. Please find the artifacts by clickin in the run [of the Package workflow](https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/into-cps-application/actions?query=workflow%3APackage).

These builds represent ongoing work. They have not been fully tested and are
not guaranteed to work. Normally, you are advised to use one of the
[releases](https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/into-cps-application/releases).
